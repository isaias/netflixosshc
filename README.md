Running
=============
If you have a trial account you can't run 2 applications at same time, so I suggest you to run Hystrix-Dashboard on your local machine and the netflixosshc on SAP HANA Cloud

To run Hystrix-Dashboard see this instructions:

Clone https://github.com/Netflix/Hystrix project, after follow this instructions https://github.com/Netflix/Hystrix/tree/master/hystrix-dashboard

After Dashboard is running put the address of hystrix.stream that was deployed on SAP HANA Cloud. 

Example: https://netflixosshcs0004616922trial.hanatrial.ondemand.com/netflixosshc/hystrix.stream
